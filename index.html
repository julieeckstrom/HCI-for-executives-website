                    <p>This course provides an overview and introduction to the field of human&#45;computer interaction, with a focus on how it applies to managers, technology executives, and others who will work with HCI professionals. Particular emphasis will be placed on what HCI methods and HCI&#45;trained specialists can bring to design and development teams. The course will provide a hands&#45;on introduction to proven tools and techniques for creating and improving user interfaces, such as Contextual Inquiry, Rapid Prototyping, Heuristic Analysis, and Think&#45;Aloud User Testing. Students at the end of the course will have learned how to perform some useful techniques and will have an understanding of systematic procedures for creating usable and useful designs and systems.</p>
                
                
                	<h3 id="nav-item2">What is HCI?</h3>
                    <p>Human computer interaction (HCI) is an interdisciplinary field in which computer scientists, engineers, psychologists, social scientists, and design professionals play important roles. The goal of HCI is to solve real problems in the design and use of technology, making computer&#45;based systems easier to use and more effective for people and organizations. Ease of use and effectiveness are critical to the success of any systems that interact with people, including software systems, home, office and factory appliances, and web and phone applications.</p>
